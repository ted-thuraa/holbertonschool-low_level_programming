## Introduction


Each directory contains the low level projects and code that I wrote during my time at Holberton. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind C, algorithms, and basic data structures. There is info and trivia questions that I go over in each directory.

## Capstone Projects  

### <a href="https://github.com/byn3/printf">printf</a>  

I wrote my own printf function with <a href="https://https://github.com/thenicopixie">Nicole Swanson</a>. This project had restrictions regarding the use of several functions and libraries, so my partner and I had to write our own functions that behaved similar to their standard counterparts. All of these files had to compile and work together to function as a printf substitute. This project challenged us when we were learning about string manipulation and memory management.

### <a href="https://github.com/byn3/simple_shell">simple_shell</a>  

This project was created by <a href="https://github.com/iamzinzi">Jinzi Zhang</a> and I. It is a simple version of the sh shell. All the outputs and exit statuses should return the same as sh's. This project focused on memory, sys calls, and pointers to pointers. Like the project above, there were limitations
